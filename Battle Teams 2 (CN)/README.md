**Introduction**

This folder is for the Chinese game *Battle Teams 2* (生死狙击2).

You can change the login channel of the launcher by replacing configuration files to <u>prevent repetitive installations</u>.

**Usage**

1. Enter the folder of the channel you need;
2. Copy (download) the `platform.xml` and the `platform_exm.ini`;
3. Find the install director of your game (Right-Click your game shortcut on the desktop and choose the `Open file location` option);
4. Paste the files mentioned in Point `2` and choose "Replace the files in the destination".

**Platforms Supported**

* Wizard (the Official version, 无端官服)
* Bilibili (哔哩哔哩)
* 4399
* Douyu (斗鱼)
* Beta (the Preview version, 测试服/体验服)
* Lenovo (联想)
* South-East Asia (Untested, 东南亚服，未测试)

**Not Available**

* Steam (CN server only)
* Wegame (Tencent)

**Supplement**

Except Steam and Wegame (these two have their own game launching methods, you have to open them before playing games), other channels are using the same launcher executable program. Only the platform configuration files can determine the BT2 login methods.

The list is incomplete. Some channels like Syjoy (顺网), Huya (虎牙), Yilewan (易乐玩) should be supported but we are still missing their files. If you are playing BT2 with one of these three channels, we will appreciate it if you share your extracted files (file names can be refer to the Usage point 2) with us.
